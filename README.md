        Mr. Kitty is a simple (IN PROGRESS) Python reverse shell project.
        When the connection is succesful, you can write commands on the client's machine. 
        It also returns the version and the name of the client's Operating System.
        For now, mrKitty is not doing too much, I just wanted to learn how can I actually do this.
        There is a lot of work, I will add other functionalities sooner or later.
```

# How do you use it?

```python
#for launching the server and listening to the incoming connections
python mainKitty.py 

#for launching the client side
python kittyPayload.py
```
